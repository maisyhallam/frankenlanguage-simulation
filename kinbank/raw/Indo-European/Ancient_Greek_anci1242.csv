"mC","páis",,,,"IE94(11)","gates_kinship_1971","páis ""child""  [94]; koûros (m), koúrē (f) ""young man"", ""young woman"" [94]; citation: Koûros and its feminine koúrē usually have a non-kin sense (‘young man’, ‘young woman’, respectively), but can also mean ‘son’ and ‘daughter’; when used in the latter sense, however, they are regularly accompanied by the genitive of a parent’s name.[note29]. The sense ‘young man (woman)’ is the etymologically original one (Frisk [1970]), and the syntactic restriction on the use of these words in reference to offspring calls to mind similar, though not identical, syntactic restrictions on boy ‘son’ in English: e.g. one can say my neighbor’s son, my neighbor’s boy, and the son of my neighbor, but not *the boy of my neighbor. Koûros ‘son’ and koúrē  ‘daughter’, however, apparently do not have the stylistic feature associated with boy ‘son' [note30]
Páis ‘child’ resembles English child in having both kin and non-kin senses. As in the case of koûros and koúrē (and child), the non-kin meaning is the original one. Unlike koûros and koúrē, however, páis is not restricted to use with the genitive of a parent’s name, but seems as free in its distribution as huiós or thugáter [note31][94:11] more info: [94:12,13]"
"mC","tékos",,,,"IE94(11)","gates_kinship_1971","tékos, téknon ""child"" [94]; citation: Tékos and téknon, like páis, refer to offspring of either sex, but they clearly differ from páis in two ways: they are never used (in reference) in the non-kin sense ‘young person’, and they can refer to animal as well as human offspring (in the latter respect, they differ from all the other offspring terms)[note32]. Téknon (in reference) is always plural: cf. English young.  Homer thus has three words which can refer to human offspring without specifying sex: páis, tékos, and téknon. His choice of word depends partly on metrical convenience, but there are certain differences in usage which suggest that there is indeed a semantic difference among these terms.[note33] Tékos is apparently a more impersonal term than the others, emphasizing the idea of the child simply as offspring, rather than as a personal participant in the action. Téknon differs from the other two words in that it probably refers par excellence to infant children.[note34][94:11,12]"

In modern Greek, kórē ‘daughter’ is more common than thugatéra, but huiós remains the word for ‘son’ (Buck [1949][..]).[94:38]; citation (about -os / -ē pairs): huiós ‘son’ (Mycenaean Greek); huiḗ ‘daughter’ ([1st] c.

The other three compound words for grandparents occur later (rnatromátōr and patromátōr are found in Pindar, e.g. [...], patropátōr in Lykophron), but they were presumably known to Homer. Mētromḗtor is of course excluded from hexameter verse. These compound grandparent terms are not rare in later Greek, but they are confined to poetry for the most part. The regular Attic prose terms are páppos ‘grandfather’ and tḗthē ‘grandmother’.[94:19,20]        But the most usual Homeric expressions for grandparents are the descriptive phrases patròs (emoîo) patḗr ‘(my) father’s father’ [...], mētròs patḗr ‘mother’s father’ [...], mḗtēr ... mētrós ‘mother’s mother [...]. The way these phrases are used suggests that they were a usual way of referring to grandparents in the traditional epic language, and not ad hoc creations of Homer: they participate in formulas which recur at fixed points in the line, such as line-initial patròs (emoîo) patḗr, occurring twice.
Neither páppos ‘grandfather’ nor tḗthē ‘grandmother’ is used by Homer: he always specifies the sex of the linking parent. This does not imply, however, that páppos and tḗthē were unknown to Homer, since in four of the six references to grandparents, the linking parent figures prominently in the context, and this would give sufficient reason for mentioning him specifically [...]. A series of terms for grandfather, great-grandfather, etc., is attested from post-Homeric sources: páppos ‘grandfather’, própappos ‘great-grandfather’, ékpappos ‘great-great-grandfather’, pappepípappos ‘greatgreat-great-grandfather’, and trípappos ‘great-great-great-great-grandfather’.
The similar Latin series has perhaps been borrowed from Greek, but Skt. prapitāmaha 'great~grandfather' and OP apanyāka ‘great-great-grandfather’ suggest that this method of referring to distant ascendants was a feature of PIE terminology and hence, by implication, known to Homer.[note72][94:20]"

The word is not found in Attic prose.[note73] It is clearly composed of huiós ‘son’ plus the suffix -ōnos (on this suffix, see Chantraine [...]). The meaning of this rare suffix here is in doubt: the evidence is not sufficient to decide whether huiōnós is an endocentric formation, like grandson or French petit-fils, applicable to either son’s son or daughter’s son, or an exocentric formation, like Attic Greek huïdoûs, applicable only to son’s son. (more info: 94:20,21); citation (about -os / -ē kinship pairs): huiōnós ‘grandson’, (perhaps only ‘son’s son’: see [...]) (first attested in Homer); huionḗ ‘granddaughter’ (first attested in Josephus, [1st] c.

LSJ cite only one occurrence of huiōnós between Homer and the [1st] century B.C., in the archaistic poem Theokritos 17 [see ...], and lexicographers describe the term as less Attic than huīdoûs (see LSJ[...]). This suggests either the survival of a huiōnós/ -ḗ pair in non-Attic dialects (perhaps Ionic [...]) or the late revival of Homeric huiōnós and the creation of a feminine for it. The pair  huiōnós/ -ḗ may thus be as old as Homer or as late as Josephus. [94:37,38]"

While the feminines akoítēs, and parakoítēs have associations with personal relationship (see previous section), the masculine terms seem to be simply emotionally charged words for ‘husband’.

The sense ‘young man (woman)’ is the etymologically original one (Frisk [1970]), and the syntactic restriction on the use of these words in reference to offspring calls to mind similar, though not identical, syntactic restrictions on boy ‘son’ in English: e.g. one can say my neighbor’s son, my neighbor’s boy, and the son of my neighbor, but not *the boy of my neighbor. Koûros ‘son’ and koúrē  ‘daughter’, however, apparently do not have the stylistic feature associated with boy ‘son' [note30]
Páis ‘child’ resembles English child in having both kin and non-kin senses. As in the case of koûros and koúrē (and child), the non-kin meaning is the original one. Unlike koûros and koúrē, however, páis is not restricted to use with the genitive of a parent’s name, but seems as free in its distribution as huiós or thugáter [note31][94:11] more info: [94:12,13]"

Téknon (in reference) is always plural: cf. English young.  Homer thus has three words which can refer to human offspring without specifying sex: páis, tékos, and téknon. His choice of word depends partly on metrical convenience, but there are certain differences in usage which suggest that there is indeed a semantic difference among these terms.[note33] Tékos is apparently a more impersonal term than the others, emphasizing the idea of the child simply as offspring, rather than as a personal participant in the action.

The other three compound words for grandparents occur later (rnatromátōr and patromátōr are found in Pindar, e.g. [...], patropátōr in Lykophron), but they were presumably known to Homer. Mētromḗtor is of course excluded from hexameter verse. These compound grandparent terms are not rare in later Greek, but they are confined to poetry for the most part. The regular Attic prose terms are páppos ‘grandfather’ and tḗthē ‘grandmother’.[94:19,20]        But the most usual Homeric expressions for grandparents are the descriptive phrases patròs (emoîo) patḗr ‘(my) father’s father’ [...], mētròs patḗr ‘mother’s father’ [...], mḗtēr ... mētrós ‘mother’s mother [...]. The way these phrases are used suggests that they were a usual way of referring to grandparents in the traditional epic language, and not ad hoc creations of Homer: they participate in formulas which recur at fixed points in the line, such as line-initial patròs (emoîo) patḗr, occurring twice.
Neither páppos ‘grandfather’ nor tḗthē ‘grandmother’ is used by Homer: he always specifies the sex of the linking parent. This does not imply, however, that páppos and tḗthē were unknown to Homer, since in four of the six references to grandparents, the linking parent figures prominently in the context, and this would give sufficient reason for mentioning him specifically [...]. A series of terms for grandfather, great-grandfather, etc., is attested from post-Homeric sources: páppos ‘grandfather’, própappos ‘great-grandfather’, ékpappos ‘great-great-grandfather’, pappepípappos ‘greatgreat-great-grandfather’, and trípappos ‘great-great-great-great-grandfather’.
The similar Latin series has perhaps been borrowed from Greek, but Skt. prapitāmaha 'great~grandfather' and OP apanyāka ‘great-great-grandfather’ suggest that this method of referring to distant ascendants was a feature of PIE terminology and hence, by implication, known to Homer.[note72][94:20]"

"fH","anḗr",,,,"IE94(18,19)","gates_kinship_1971","citation: Homer uses four terms for ‘husband’: anḗr, pósis, akoítēs, and parakoítēs. Of these, pósis and anḗr are the only ones inherited from PIE.[note66][94:18]; citation: Anḗr is the regular word for ‘husband’ in post-Homeric Greek.[note67] Anḗr is parallel to gunḗ in having the sense ‘man’ as well as the sense ‘husband’; the sense ‘husband’, however, is comparatively rare; Latacs [...] cites only [17] places, out of several hundred, where  anḗr has the meaning ‘husband’.[note68] As in the case of the terms for ‘wife’, a distinction can be seen between simple kin terms (anḗr, pósis) and terms which have personal or emotional associations (akoítēs, and parakoítēs), but the nature of the difference is not the same as it is for the feminine terms. While the feminines akoítēs, and parakoítēs have associations with personal relationship (see previous section), the masculine terms seem to be simply emotionally charged words for ‘husband’. (examples and more info) [94:19]; Anḗr and pósis do not seem to differ clearly in meaning. The only clear difference in the use of these terms is that anḗr is often used in close proximity to gunḗ, while pósis is typically used with álokhos. This fact was noticed already by Delbrück [1889][...] Anḗr and gunḗ have certain features in common: they are both the regular terms used in later Greek, and perhaps in Homer’s daily speech, they are the only terms used in address in Homer, and both terms have the more general meaning ‘man’ or ‘woman’.[94:19]"

None of these words is surely inherited from PIE in this sense.[note55] Gunḗ is the only one which was current in later prose, and it may well have been the only term used by Homer and his audience in colloquial speech.[note17] [94:16,17](more info) [...] citation: To sum up, none of the Homeric terms for ‘wife’ has any associations of legitimacy absent from the others. Álokhos, gunḗ, dámar, and óar are kin terms referring to the kin type ‘wife’ in terms of her position in the family. Ákoitis and parákoitis, on the other hand, are not kin terms strictly speaking; they refer to the personal relationship between a man and a woman who happens to be his wife.[94:18]"

Several Indo-European languages, moreover, merge the son’s wife and brother’s wife, though not using terms cognate with nuós: e.g. common Slavic *nevést(k)a (Friedrich [1966:13]), Skt. vadhū ‘CA, female’ (originally ‘bride’: cf. nuós ‘bride’ in Doric Greek, e.g. Theokritos [...]).[94:25]"

The influence of this pressure is visible, for example, in the demise of nuós ‘CA, female’. This word is the only non-compound kinship term which still reflects the PIE state of affairs, in which -os nouns could refer to females. Given the structure of the Greek kinship system, such a term could not be expected to survive, and it is, indeed, replaced in Hellenistic times by númphē (originally ‘bride’, first ‘daughter-in-law’ in the Septuagint); the similar beginnings of the words no doubt facilitated the replacement.
