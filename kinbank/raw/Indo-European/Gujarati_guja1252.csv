In old Gujarāti the word putta, puttu, puta and suya are used. They are not
found in modem Gujarāti. 
Besides these words the word gagā is used in Kāthiāwād. 
The word mobhī meaning the main beam on which the roof is supported, is used in the sense of ‘son’, because the son represents the support of the house. Besides these, purely Sanskrit words like putra, tanaya etc. are used in literature in modern times. The words pūta and chaiyo are found in folk-sayings even in modern times.

In this sense the word is the antithesis of the word mahyāri which connotes the women born in a family.

This would only be true of higher castes and of the Patidar of the towns and wealthier villages. For such the term means simply ‘woman’ and could not suitably be used of a man’s wife. In smaller villages among the bulk of the Patidar and in the truly rural sections of other castes, including Brahmans, bāiri has no pejorative associations and quite simply means ‘wife’. There is no reason why this should not be so. The word is only a variant of bāiḍi, a diminutive for mother.
