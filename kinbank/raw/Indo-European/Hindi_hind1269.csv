If it was ""the owner"" it did not possibly suggest ""the owner of the wife"", because the ""wife"" was patnī ""the female owner"" or ""the mistress"" and jointly ""the husband and the wife"" were  dampatī, that is, the master and the mistress of the house or household objects.

According to Turner, however, the origin of this word is a Nursery word (Lallwort). MF is often given a separate term in different [Indo-Aryan] languages. In many languages it is  nānā. [9]; in Hindi, there is clear differentiation between father's and mother's relatives not not only according to the kin terminology but also to the social role and canon of respect: dādā (FF) (without it's literal meaning) in vulgar language has a figurative meaning ""chieftain"" or ""head of a group"" (and the phrase  dādā bānnā means ""to lead""), while  nānī (MM) is used in phrases as a form of mocking (the phrase nānī marnā, ""death of a grandmother"" is used to mock someone's misfortune); when children address an old unknown man, the proper term is  dādā (and not  nānā (MF)), and for a middle-aged man   cācā (FB) and not  māmā (MB) [13:31,32]; bābā ""FF"" (also includes FFB, FMB, FFZH, etc) [115:98]; dada ""father's father""  [219]; dādā, bābā ""father's father"" [223]"
