An unmarried female agnate is always referred to as amanat, that is as some one held in trust on behalf of her lawful ’owners’. A young girl’s upbringing is completely overshadowed by the fact that she is to be married and sent away to live with her husband and parents-in-law. [...] Taking an overall view of the composite status of a woman in the Pandit kinship system, the social primacy of the role of wife stands out. Significantly, the Kashmiri word for woman-zanana-is also the commonly used term for wife : the others are  garawajin (mistress of the house), triy, (woman) and kolai.[121:221]"

He is expected all his life to be an ally, supporter and well-wisher of the other man. Thus alone, it is said, does he give expression to his genuine concern for the well-being of his sister. After his father dies, and he assumes the role of the head (karta) of his household, he also becomes the gift-giver to his sister and her household. To quote a Kashmiri proverb again: A brother though but seven years old must give gifts to his sixty-year-old sister (sata vuhur boi ta shetha varishbeni). Gift-giving, as I shall show below, is a most crucial cultural performance indicative of the existence of affinal links between households. [121:226]; [...] I might mention the association of some derogation with the use of the term mam in abnormal situations, but this must be done with great caution. As far as I know, Dumont is the only scholar who has drawn attention to the importance of this clue (Dumont 1966a : 102). He has written of the Hindi term sala as being clearly abusive when applied to a person other than the speaker’s actual wife’s brother. Dumont significantly adds that the term mama also is ’tinged’ with a ’trace’ of abusiveness, pointing to the two statuses being viewed as belonging together in the category of affines.[...]  Now, among the Pandits, hahar (WB) and hihur (W/HF) are not abusive terms as such. Their use as terms of reference by men and women is both common and courteous. They are not used as terms of address, however, for the Pandits generally avoid doing so uniformly with the possible though not common exception of the terms for mother’s brother and mother’s sister. To address a person by the term of reference is considered undesirable and too familiar to be decent [...] [121:228]"

An unmarried female agnate is always referred to as amanat, that is as some one held in trust on behalf of her lawful ’owners’. A young girl’s upbringing is completely overshadowed by the fact that she is to be married and sent away to live with her husband and parents-in-law. [...] Taking an overall view of the composite status of a woman in the Pandit kinship system, the social primacy of the role of wife stands out. Significantly, the Kashmiri word for woman-zanana-is also the commonly used term for wife : the others are  garawajin (mistress of the house), triy, (woman) and kolai.[121:221]"

He is expected all his life to be an ally, supporter and well-wisher of the other man. Thus alone, it is said, does he give expression to his genuine concern for the well-being of his sister. After his father dies, and he assumes the role of the head (karta) of his household, he also becomes the gift-giver to his sister and her household. To quote a Kashmiri proverb again: A brother though but seven years old must give gifts to his sixty-year-old sister (sata vuhur boi ta shetha varishbeni). Gift-giving, as I shall show below, is a most crucial cultural performance indicative of the existence of affinal links between households. [121:226]; [...] I might mention the association of some derogation with the use of the term mam in abnormal situations, but this must be done with great caution. As far as I know, Dumont is the only scholar who has drawn attention to the importance of this clue (Dumont 1966a : 102). He has written of the Hindi term sala as being clearly abusive when applied to a person other than the speaker’s actual wife’s brother. Dumont significantly adds that the term mama also is ’tinged’ with a ’trace’ of abusiveness, pointing to the two statuses being viewed as belonging together in the category of affines.[...]  Now, among the Pandits, hahar (WB) and hihur (W/HF) are not abusive terms as such. Their use as terms of reference by men and women is both common and courteous. They are not used as terms of address, however, for the Pandits generally avoid doing so uniformly with the possible though not common exception of the terms for mother’s brother and mother’s sister. To address a person by the term of reference is considered undesirable and too familiar to be decent [...] [121:228]"

He is expected all his life to be an ally, supporter and well-wisher of the other man. Thus alone, it is said, does he give expression to his genuine concern for the well-being of his sister. After his father dies, and he assumes the role of the head (karta) of his household, he also becomes the gift-giver to his sister and her household. To quote a Kashmiri proverb again: A brother though but seven years old must give gifts to his sixty-year-old sister (sata vuhur boi ta shetha varishbeni). Gift-giving, as I shall show below, is a most crucial cultural performance indicative of the existence of affinal links between households. [121:226]; [...] I might mention the association of some derogation with the use of the term mam in abnormal situations, but this must be done with great caution. As far as I know, Dumont is the only scholar who has drawn attention to the importance of this clue (Dumont 1966a : 102). He has written of the Hindi term sala as being clearly abusive when applied to a person other than the speaker’s actual wife’s brother. Dumont significantly adds that the term mama also is ’tinged’ with a ’trace’ of abusiveness, pointing to the two statuses being viewed as belonging together in the category of affines.[...]  Now, among the Pandits, hahar (WB) and hihur (W/HF) are not abusive terms as such. Their use as terms of reference by men and women is both common and courteous. They are not used as terms of address, however, for the Pandits generally avoid doing so uniformly with the possible though not common exception of the terms for mother’s brother and mother’s sister. To address a person by the term of reference is considered undesirable and too familiar to be decent [...] [121:228]"

He is expected all his life to be an ally, supporter and well-wisher of the other man. Thus alone, it is said, does he give expression to his genuine concern for the well-being of his sister. After his father dies, and he assumes the role of the head (karta) of his household, he also becomes the gift-giver to his sister and her household. To quote a Kashmiri proverb again: A brother though but seven years old must give gifts to his sixty-year-old sister (sata vuhur boi ta shetha varishbeni). Gift-giving, as I shall show below, is a most crucial cultural performance indicative of the existence of affinal links between households. [121:226]; [...] I might mention the association of some derogation with the use of the term mam in abnormal situations, but this must be done with great caution. As far as I know, Dumont is the only scholar who has drawn attention to the importance of this clue (Dumont 1966a : 102). He has written of the Hindi term sala as being clearly abusive when applied to a person other than the speaker’s actual wife’s brother. Dumont significantly adds that the term mama also is ’tinged’ with a ’trace’ of abusiveness, pointing to the two statuses being viewed as belonging together in the category of affines.[...]  Now, among the Pandits, hahar (WB) and hihur (W/HF) are not abusive terms as such. Their use as terms of reference by men and women is both common and courteous. They are not used as terms of address, however, for the Pandits generally avoid doing so uniformly with the possible though not common exception of the terms for mother’s brother and mother’s sister. To address a person by the term of reference is considered undesirable and too familiar to be decent [...] [121:228]"

He is expected all his life to be an ally, supporter and well-wisher of the other man. Thus alone, it is said, does he give expression to his genuine concern for the well-being of his sister. After his father dies, and he assumes the role of the head (karta) of his household, he also becomes the gift-giver to his sister and her household. To quote a Kashmiri proverb again: A brother though but seven years old must give gifts to his sixty-year-old sister (sata vuhur boi ta shetha varishbeni). Gift-giving, as I shall show below, is a most crucial cultural performance indicative of the existence of affinal links between households. [121:226]; [...] I might mention the association of some derogation with the use of the term mam in abnormal situations, but this must be done with great caution. As far as I know, Dumont is the only scholar who has drawn attention to the importance of this clue (Dumont 1966a : 102). He has written of the Hindi term sala as being clearly abusive when applied to a person other than the speaker’s actual wife’s brother. Dumont significantly adds that the term mama also is ’tinged’ with a ’trace’ of abusiveness, pointing to the two statuses being viewed as belonging together in the category of affines.[...]  Now, among the Pandits, hahar (WB) and hihur (W/HF) are not abusive terms as such. Their use as terms of reference by men and women is both common and courteous. They are not used as terms of address, however, for the Pandits generally avoid doing so uniformly with the possible though not common exception of the terms for mother’s brother and mother’s sister. To address a person by the term of reference is considered undesirable and too familiar to be decent [...] [121:228]"

[...] Taking an overall view of the composite status of a woman in the Pandit kinship system, the social primacy of the role of wife stands out.

He is expected all his life to be an ally, supporter and well-wisher of the other man. Thus alone, it is said, does he give expression to his genuine concern for the well-being of his sister. After his father dies, and he assumes the role of the head (karta) of his household, he also becomes the gift-giver to his sister and her household. To quote a Kashmiri proverb again: A brother though but seven years old must give gifts to his sixty-year-old sister (sata vuhur boi ta shetha varishbeni). Gift-giving, as I shall show below, is a most crucial cultural performance indicative of the existence of affinal links between households. [121:226]; [...] I might mention the association of some derogation with the use of the term mam in abnormal situations, but this must be done with great caution. As far as I know, Dumont is the only scholar who has drawn attention to the importance of this clue (Dumont 1966a : 102). He has written of the Hindi term sala as being clearly abusive when applied to a person other than the speaker’s actual wife’s brother. Dumont significantly adds that the term mama also is ’tinged’ with a ’trace’ of abusiveness, pointing to the two statuses being viewed as belonging together in the category of affines.[...]  Now, among the Pandits, hahar (WB) and hihur (W/HF) are not abusive terms as such. Their use as terms of reference by men and women is both common and courteous. They are not used as terms of address, however, for the Pandits generally avoid doing so uniformly with the possible though not common exception of the terms for mother’s brother and mother’s sister. To address a person by the term of reference is considered undesirable and too familiar to be decent [...] [121:228]"

[...] Taking an overall view of the composite status of a woman in the Pandit kinship system, the social primacy of the role of wife stands out.

He is expected all his life to be an ally, supporter and well-wisher of the other man. Thus alone, it is said, does he give expression to his genuine concern for the well-being of his sister. After his father dies, and he assumes the role of the head (karta) of his household, he also becomes the gift-giver to his sister and her household. To quote a Kashmiri proverb again: A brother though but seven years old must give gifts to his sixty-year-old sister (sata vuhur boi ta shetha varishbeni). Gift-giving, as I shall show below, is a most crucial cultural performance indicative of the existence of affinal links between households. [121:226]; [...] I might mention the association of some derogation with the use of the term mam in abnormal situations, but this must be done with great caution. As far as I know, Dumont is the only scholar who has drawn attention to the importance of this clue (Dumont 1966a : 102). He has written of the Hindi term sala as being clearly abusive when applied to a person other than the speaker’s actual wife’s brother. Dumont significantly adds that the term mama also is ’tinged’ with a ’trace’ of abusiveness, pointing to the two statuses being viewed as belonging together in the category of affines.[...]  Now, among the Pandits, hahar (WB) and hihur (W/HF) are not abusive terms as such. Their use as terms of reference by men and women is both common and courteous. They are not used as terms of address, however, for the Pandits generally avoid doing so uniformly with the possible though not common exception of the terms for mother’s brother and mother’s sister. To address a person by the term of reference is considered undesirable and too familiar to be decent [...] [121:228]"

An unmarried female agnate is always referred to as amanat, that is as some one held in trust on behalf of her lawful ’owners’. A young girl’s upbringing is completely overshadowed by the fact that she is to be married and sent away to live with her husband and parents-in-law. [...] Taking an overall view of the composite status of a woman in the Pandit kinship system, the social primacy of the role of wife stands out. Significantly, the Kashmiri word for woman-zanana-is also the commonly used term for wife : the others are  garawajin (mistress of the house), triy, (woman) and kolai.[121:221]"

He is expected all his life to be an ally, supporter and well-wisher of the other man. Thus alone, it is said, does he give expression to his genuine concern for the well-being of his sister. After his father dies, and he assumes the role of the head (karta) of his household, he also becomes the gift-giver to his sister and her household. To quote a Kashmiri proverb again: A brother though but seven years old must give gifts to his sixty-year-old sister (sata vuhur boi ta shetha varishbeni). Gift-giving, as I shall show below, is a most crucial cultural performance indicative of the existence of affinal links between households. [121:226]; [...] I might mention the association of some derogation with the use of the term mam in abnormal situations, but this must be done with great caution. As far as I know, Dumont is the only scholar who has drawn attention to the importance of this clue (Dumont 1966a : 102). He has written of the Hindi term sala as being clearly abusive when applied to a person other than the speaker’s actual wife’s brother. Dumont significantly adds that the term mama also is ’tinged’ with a ’trace’ of abusiveness, pointing to the two statuses being viewed as belonging together in the category of affines.[...]  Now, among the Pandits, hahar (WB) and hihur (W/HF) are not abusive terms as such. Their use as terms of reference by men and women is both common and courteous. They are not used as terms of address, however, for the Pandits generally avoid doing so uniformly with the possible though not common exception of the terms for mother’s brother and mother’s sister. To address a person by the term of reference is considered undesirable and too familiar to be decent [...] [121:228]"
