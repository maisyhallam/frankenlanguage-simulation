[...] The ka suffix might have been used to denote ""slightly less than"". As both FF and FeB could be considered slightly less than the father in estimation, tātaka might have been used for them.

The choice of one derivative for ""mother"" and another for ""grandmother"" in Marathi is thus very interesting from the socio-linguistic points of view.

Marathi has however the term  ājī for the grand mother as ājā for grandfather.   Both āyī [and ...] and ājī are derived from Sanskrit āryikā, Prakrit  ayyiā, and ajjiā). Again  ājā [...] is derived from Sanskrit  āryaka, Prakrit ajjaa. The choice of one derivative for ""mother"" and another for ""grandmother"" in Marathi is thus very interesting from the socio-linguistic points of view. [...]  [9:107];          (citation: Sindhi has still preserved, like some other Indian languages like Marathi, the term āī, derived like aiya and ā'i (no longer used in modern Hindi) from Sans. āryā > Prakrit ayyā (see footnote for source)) [188:345]"
