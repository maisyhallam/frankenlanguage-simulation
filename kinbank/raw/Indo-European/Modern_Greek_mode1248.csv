The use of the word kyris signifies that the relationship between the father and his children was probably an authoritarian one. It is also another indication of the father ’s role 
as head of the household. In this context, no term similar to kyris is found for the mother [...][103:304]; [...] in Mani, [...] a wife called her husband afentis (master, lord) (Alexakis, [1980], p. [243]).[103:307]; patéras ""father""; also: babás [101:1086]"
