Let us first examine its meaning in these non-kinship contexts. When a person wishes to address a male stranger, roughly of the same generation as himself he always chooses the term bhai (in Punjabi phai sahab or pra jee) [...] it seems to us that the term bhai is specifically used here to exclude the usage of sala and jeeja, rather than to include the speaker among one’s brothers.[122]; bhāi ""brother"" in general, sometimes used for yB in particular; term derived from Sankskrit  bhrātā; (another term given here is:) parāh ""brother"" (and the same comments as on bhāi) [9]; bhāī, bhayyā, bīr, mājāya  ""brother"" (all B in general) [223]"
